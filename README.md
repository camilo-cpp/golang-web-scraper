# **BASIC**!!! Web Scraper for Board Games on Mercado Libre (Using Colly)

This project is a web scraper that extracts information from a list of board games on Mercado Libre. It retrieves the name, price, coupon availability, and shipping cost for each game. Additionally, it generates a file with the extracted data.

## What is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves automated retrieval of information from HTML pages using a script or a program. In this project, we utilize web scraping techniques to gather data from Mercado Libre's board game listings.

## Usage

To use this project, you can run the following command:

```
go run cmd/api/main.go
```

This will execute the `main.go` file and start the web scraping process. Make sure you have Go installed on your machine before running this command.

After the scraping is complete, the extracted data will be saved in a file.
